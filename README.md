## Project Description 



A simple, dynamic workday scheduler that allows an individual to track their daily tasks and save them for later use. The scheduler reflects the current date and time. Each hour available on the scheduler will change color based on if it is in the past, present, or future of the current time. This is a tool to assist in daily personal organization in a format that is easily navigated and will remain that way regardless of the size of the screen. The user should find they are able to easily add their various tasks and manage them throughout the day.
